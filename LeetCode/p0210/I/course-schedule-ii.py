# Description: There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to
# take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array
# `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that
# you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.
#
# *   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course
#     `0` you have to first take course `1`.
#
# Return *the ordering of courses you should take to finish all
# courses*. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If
# it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1
# you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is
# [0,1].
#
# Example 2:
# Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
# Output: [0,2,1,3]
# Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3
# you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2
# should be taken after you finished course 0.
# So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
#
# Example 3:
# Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
# Output: [0]
#
# Constraints:
# *   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
# *   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
# *   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
# *   `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
# *   `ai != bi`
# *   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.
