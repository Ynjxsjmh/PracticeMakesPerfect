# Description: Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest
# substring** without repeating characters.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence
# and not a substring.
#
# Constraints:
# *   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
# *   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
